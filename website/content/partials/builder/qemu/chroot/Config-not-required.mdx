<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/qemu/chroot/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `source_image` (string) - Packer builds from a qcow2 format image file, this parameter is the path of
  source image file

- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the resulting qcow2 image be created.
  This may be relative or absolute.
  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when packer
  is executed. This directory must not exist prior to running the builder.
  By default this is output-BUILDNAME where "BUILDNAME" is the
  name of the build.

- `image_name` (string) - The output image file name, ".qcow2" suffix will be added automatically.

- `mount_options` ([]string) - Options to supply the mount command when mounting devices. Each option
  will be prefixed with -o and supplied to the mount command ran by
  Packer. Because this command is ran in a shell, user discretion is
  advised. See this manual page for the mount command for valid file
  system specific options.

- `mount_partition` (string) - The partition number containing the / partition. By default this is the
  first partition of the volume, (for example, xvda1) but you can
  designate the entire block device by setting "mount_partition": "0" in
  your config, which will mount xvda instead.

- `mount_path` (string) - The path where the volume will be mounted. This is where the chroot
  environment will be. This defaults to
  `/mnt/packer-qemu-chroot-volumes/{{.Device}}`. This is a configuration
  template where the .Device variable is replaced with the name of the
  device where the volume is attached.

- `chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - This is a list of devices to mount into the chroot environment. This
  configuration parameter requires some additional documentation which is
  in the Chroot Mounts section. Please read that section for more
  information on how to use this.

- `command_wrapper` (string) - How to run shell commands. This defaults to `{{.Command}}`. This may be
  useful to set if you want to set environmental variables or perhaps run
  it with sudo or so on. This is a configuration template where the
  .Command variable is replaced with the command to be run. Defaults to
  `{{.Command}}`.

- `copy_files` ([]string) - Paths to files on the host that will be copied into the
  chroot environment prior to provisioning. Defaults to /etc/resolv.conf
  so that DNS lookups work. Pass an empty list to skip copying
  /etc/resolv.conf. You may need to do this if you're building an image
  that uses systemd.
